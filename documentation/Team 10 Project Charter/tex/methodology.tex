To minimize costs and time, we will be using OpenEMR working as the back end of our project. OpenEMR is an open source software that features electronic medical records, management for medical practices, scheduling, and electronic billing. We are going to build a front-end user interface that will organize the components of OpenEMR that simplifies the workflow and minimizing its usage.
One issue noted is that there is no search engine to find all the user interface elements of Epic EMR, such as dates of patient visits, schedules, amounts of medicine administered, and much more. Each of these components have a keyword to them that can be searched. Another issue is that Epic EHR does not have a streamlined process to billing.
