Due to the nature of the project, it will be software heavy and will not require a specific facility to create or host it. All of our productivity depends on using a computer with network connections that allows us to use development tools of libraries, frameworks, code editors, and GitHub. For our equipment, we will only be using open source software that is free to use. Our purchases will be only on a need basis depending on what is required to complete this project, and otherwise will use resources that are available to us free of cost as students at the University of Texas at Arlington.During the requirements stage we plan of meeting medical professionals who have experience working with the billing software that is being used currently.In order to test the system, we may ask medical professionals or similar to use the application. This application will be hosted online for proper testing which may require spending depending on the resources website hosts can provide.
