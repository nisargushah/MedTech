This project is meant to serve the medical community with helping them minimize the charting time. So this project will mainly be focused on improving the UI/UX and smarter layout for application with collective effort to make a seamless integration of state-of-the art technologies meant to help maximize the readability of the system as compared to the industry standard of software such as Epic. 

\subsection{Log-in for medical staff}
\subsubsection{Description}
The medical staff like nurses and doctors should be able to create their unique account and then later log-in with that. Every employee should have one and only one account.
